## Description
This project has been done before. Its pages are cool and compact, which requires high layout. Combining with Vue framework, it achieves a lot of data-driven view effects. Among them, many technologies are used, including percentage layout (adaptive), use of elementary and eCharts components, iframe inline framework and SCSS style writing.

If it helps you, please give me your star, thank you.
